# tree.py

This program was made to traverse a perfect binary tree to find the parent node for each node given to it, indicated by its number.
The program mathematically computes it instead of creating an actual tree structure.

# largest_product.py

This program is fairly self explanatory, it creates the largest product in a given list of numbers.
This includes negative numbers as well.
